# BOSS Syllabus

This repository is built using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) to generate a syllabus/book.

## Local Development

If you have `mdbook` installed, you can run:

```bash
mdbook serve --open
```

This will start a local server and open the book in your browser.

## Deployment

Changes to the `main` branch are automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.
