## F. Glossary (Validated Against bitcoincore.academy) ✅

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **UTXO** | An unspent transaction output that can be spent as an input in a new transaction with a valid `ScriptSig` |
| **Mempool** | Collection of valid transactions learned from P2P network but not yet confirmed in a block |
| **Confirmation** | Once a transaction is included in a block, it has one confirmation. Six or more is considered sufficient proof that a transaction cannot be reversed |
| **Consensus** | When several nodes have the same blocks in their locally-validated best block chain |
| **Consensus Rules** | The block validation rules that full nodes follow to stay in consensus |
| **Script** | Bitcoin uses a scripting system that is Forth-like, simple, stack-based, and processed left to right. Purposefully not Turing-complete |
| **ScriptPubKey** | Script included in outputs which sets conditions for spending those satoshis |
| **ScriptSig** | Data generated by a spender to satisfy a pubkey script |
| **HD Protocol** | Hierarchical Deterministic key creation and transfer protocol (BIP-32) |
| **CKD** | Child key derivation functions - compute child extended key from parent and index |
| **PSBT** | Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction format (BIP 174, BIP 370) |
| **CPFP** | Child-Pays-For-Parent - pay high fee to incentivize confirming parent transaction |
| **RBF** | Replace-by-fee - replacements must pay for their own cost plus the fee of replaced transactions |
| **Dust** | An output so small that spending it costs more in fees than it's worth |

## G. Wallet Component Structure ⚠️

Per bitcoincore.academy/components-overview.html:

```mermaid

    subgraph WalletStructure["Wallet Structure"]
        CW["CWallet"]
        WDB["WalletDatabase"]
        SPKM["ScriptPubKeyMan (base)"]
        DSPKM["DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan"]
        LSPKM["LegacyScriptPubKeyMan"]
        SP["SigningProvider"]
        IC["Interfaces::Chain"]
        LOCK["cs_wallet (lock)"]
    end
