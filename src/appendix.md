## F. Glossary (Validated Against bitcoincore.academy) ✅

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **UTXO** | An unspent transaction output that can be spent as an input in a new transaction with a valid `ScriptSig` |
| **Mempool** | Collection of valid transactions learned from P2P network but not yet confirmed in a block |
| **Confirmation** | Once a transaction is included in a block, it has one confirmation. Six or more is considered sufficient proof that a transaction cannot be reversed |
| **Consensus** | When several nodes have the same blocks in their locally-validated best block chain |
| **Consensus Rules** | The block validation rules that full nodes follow to stay in consensus |
| **Script** | Bitcoin uses a scripting system that is Forth-like, simple, stack-based, and processed left to right. Purposefully not Turing-complete |
| **ScriptPubKey** | Script included in outputs which sets conditions for spending those satoshis |
| **ScriptSig** | Data generated by a spender to satisfy a pubkey script |
| **HD Protocol** | Hierarchical Deterministic key creation and transfer protocol (BIP-32) |
| **CKD** | Child key derivation functions - compute child extended key from parent and index |
| **PSBT** | Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction format (BIP 174, BIP 370) |
| **CPFP** | Child-Pays-For-Parent - pay high fee to incentivize confirming parent transaction |
| **RBF** | Replace-by-fee - replacements must pay for their own cost plus the fee of replaced transactions |
| **Dust** | An output so small that spending it costs more in fees than it's worth |

## G. Wallet Component Structure ⚠️

Per bitcoincore.academy/components-overview.html:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph WalletStructure["Wallet Structure"]
        CW["CWallet"]
        WDB["WalletDatabase"]
        SPKM["ScriptPubKeyMan (base)"]
        DSPKM["DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan"]
        LSPKM["LegacyScriptPubKeyMan"]
        SP["SigningProvider"]
        IC["Interfaces::Chain"]
        LOCK["cs_wallet (lock)"]
    end
    
    CW --> WDB
    CW --> SPKM
    SPKM --> DSPKM
    SPKM --> LSPKM
    DSPKM --> SP
    LSPKM --> SP
    CW --> IC
    CW --> LOCK
```

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **WalletDatabase** | Represents a single wallet, handles reads/writes to disk |
| **ScriptPubKeyMan** | Base class for SPKM implementations |
| **DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan** | SPKM for descriptor-based wallets |
| **LegacyScriptPubKeyMan** | SPKM for legacy wallets |
| **SigningProvider** | Interface for a KeyStore to sign transactions from |
| **Interfaces::Chain** | Access to chain state, fee rates, notifications, tx submission |
| **cs_wallet** | Primary wallet lock for atomic operations |
